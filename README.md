# SurveyMethodologyTutorial - A full introduction to practical Survey Methodology in R
This undergraduate course is the practical component of an undergraduate lecture on Survey Methodology, given by Prof. Dr. Peter Selb. This tutorial was conceptualized by Niklas Haffert and me and is designed as a concept of distance-learning. Using contemporary R frameworks in combination with videos and live sesssions, students alternate between self- and cooperative- study tasks. This combination was strongly appreciated by the students, hence, we want to share the material for usage and additional suggestions.
