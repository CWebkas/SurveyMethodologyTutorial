This undergraduate course is the practical component of a PolScy & SoSci undergraduate lecture on Survey Methodology, given by Prof. Dr. Peter Selb. It was conceptualized by Niklas Haffert and me and is designed as a concept of distance-learning. Using contemporary R frameworks in combination with videos and live sesssions, students alternate between self- and cooperative- study tasks. This combination was strongly appreciated by the students, hence, we want to share the material for usage and additional suggestions. 

# Course Structure:
