Use a new code snippet for every exercise.

1. load the 2012 French presidential election data
2. inspect the data
3. add a unique voter id, the total number of voters and the number of voters by station
4. inspect the data again (check if new variables are correct)
5. create a variable sample_size
6. draw a simple random sample
7. draw a stratified sample (strata = station, sample size = sample_size, size of strata = adjusted to number of voters per station)
8. create a variable number_clusters
9. draw a cluster sample with probability of being sampled according to the number of voters by station (clusters = station, number of clusters = number_clusters, probability = calculated probability)
(10.) add a simple random sample as second stage to the cluster sample
